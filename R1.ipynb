It works well for simple commands, but the framework above is more flexible and can deal with complex operations. Feel free to use it though! Try: `subset(airquality, Temp > 80, select = c(Ozone, Temp))`.\n",
        "*   Notice I never modify the original object I am subsetting. It is important that when you subset that you don't over-write previously existing objects (and, in particular, the object you are subsetting), unless you recursively subset one particular object. These operations are **irreversible**, in the sense that if you over-write the object being subsetted, the information that was cut out cannot be re-used anywhere else in your code. Often times this is not desirable. If you have memory problems in your CPU, you have to balance this with keeping as few possible copies of the data as possible, but try to keep the originals intact in your workspace."
