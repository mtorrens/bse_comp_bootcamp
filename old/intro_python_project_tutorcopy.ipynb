The primary factors cited by Python users seem to be these:\\n\\nSoftware quality\\nFor many, Python’s focus on readability, coherence, and software quality in general sets it apart from other tools in the scripting world. Python code is designed to be readable, and hence reusable and maintainable—much more so than traditional scripting languages. The uniformity of Python code makes it easy to understand, even if you did not write it. In addition, Python has deep support for more advanced software reuse mechanisms, such as object-oriented programming (OOP).\\n\\nDeveloper productivity\\nPython boosts developer productivity many times beyond compiled or statically\\ntyped languages such as C, C++, and Java. Python code is typically one-third to\\none-fifth the size of equivalent C++ or Java code. That means there is less to type, less to debug, and less to maintain after the fact. Python programs also run immediately, without the lengthy compile and link steps required by some other tools, further boosting programmer speed.\\n\\nProgram portability\\nMost Python programs run unchanged on all major computer platforms. Porting\\nPython code between Linux and Windows, for example, is usually just a matter of\\ncopying a script’s code between machines. Moreover, Python offers multiple options for coding portable graphical user interfaces, database access programs, web-based systems, and more. Even operating system interfaces, including program\\nlaunches and directory processing, are as portable in Python as they can possibly be.\\n\\nSupport libraries\\nPython comes with a large collection of prebuilt and portable functionality, known as the standard library. This library supports an array of application-level programming tasks, from text pattern matching to network scripting. In addition, Python can be extended with both homegrown libraries and a vast collection of third-party application support software. Python’s third-party domain offers tools for website construction, numeric programming, serial port access, game development, and much more. The NumPy extension, for instance, has been described as a free and more powerful equivalent to the Matlab numeric programming system.\\n\\nComponent integration\\nPython scripts can easily communicate with other parts of an application, using a variety of integration mechanisms. Such integrations allow Python to be used as a product customization and extension tool. Today, Python code can invoke C and C++ libraries, can be called from C and C++ programs, can integrate with Java and .NET components, can communicate over frameworks such as COM, can\\ninterface with devices over serial ports, and can interact over networks with interfaces like SOAP, XML-RPC, and CORBA. It is not a standalone tool.\\n\\nEnjoyment\\nBecause of Python’s ease of use and built-in toolset, it can make the act of programming more pleasure than chore.
